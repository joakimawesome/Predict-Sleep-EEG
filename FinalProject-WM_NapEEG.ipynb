This analysis made use of the LISC database to determine what features of the EEG data would be the most applicable to working memory. After mining for relevant terms, we cleaned the data, extracted our features of interest, and performed k-means clustering. We then evaluated whether the clustering successfully separated the data by what working memory task the participant performed."

    "   After investigating the Nap EEG data, we became curious about whether we could use the scalp EEG signals to determine whether the participant performed a high-load or a low-load working memory task prior to sleeping. We knew from prior knowledge that sleep has a role in consolidating information and memories. Additionally, Ellenbogen et al (2006) demonstrated that sleep protects declarative memories and has a role in memory recall [1].\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Sleep deprivation can have an effect on cognitive function and performance - in Choo et al (2005), participants that were sleep deprived performed worse on the n-back working memory task than their rested counterparts [2]. Additionally, Gradisar et al (2016) observed that adolescents that are sleep deprived (less than 8 hours of sleep) or have a sufficient amount of sleep (greater than 9 hours) perform worse than adolescents with 8-9 hours of sleep on various working memory tasks [3]. The effect sleep has on working memory performance is clearly complex and nuanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Looking at this data, it is clear that sleep can have a substantial effect on working memory task performance, and that the brain has a role in consolidating memories during sleep. Thus, we are curious about whether there is a significant difference in brain activity after performing a working memory task. Pugin et al (2015) found that after undergoing working memory training, participants had an increase of slow wave activity during sleep [4]. We are curious as to whether a difference exists in nap EEG recordings without training and are investigating whether the complexity of the working memory task has a noticeable effect on the nap EEG recordings.\n",

    "However, there are many limitations to our analysis. The main issue is that our dataset is very small. This means that any algorithm we run has a high tendency to overfit our data and confound the results. To better test our question, we would need to run many more classification and clustering algorithms on the data, which would take much more time than we have.\n",

    "Another limitation of our analysis is that we only extracted the power series from the data. If we had the time to be more thorough, we would have attemped to extract the power series using multiple tools. We also would have extracted more features. We chose not to extract more features due to the time constraint. We were also unclear on how to create a rectangular matrix when the features would likely all be different dimensions.\n",
